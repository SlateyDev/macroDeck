# macroDeck - Home-brew Stream Deck for Raspberry Pi

macroDeck has been created to add an extra external button interface for activating functionality on a PC (such as what
you can do with an Elgato Stream Deck).

While the Elgato Stream Deck is a collection of LCD key buttons, the macroDeck is designed to be used with a touch
enabled screen anywhere that you can run pygame, and for that it is expected to be run on a Raspberry Pi with a
connected touch screen and either ethernet or wifi.
